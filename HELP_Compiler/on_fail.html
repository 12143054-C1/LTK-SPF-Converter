    <h1>Handling Conversion Failures</h1>
    <p>If the conversion process fails, a popup window titled "Problem Detected" will appear. This window offers three options: Send Log, Help, and Cancel.</p>

        <li><strong>Help:</strong> Pressing the Help button will direct you to this page for more detailed instructions on how to handle conversion failures.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Closes the popup window and cancels the error reporting process.</li>
